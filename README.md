## ⚠️ Disclaimer — Read Before Using

**OS Assistant is experimental software.** An AI with terminal access is a powerful tool — and it can cause real damage if misused. Please understand the risks before using it.

**The AI is not your property.** OS Assistant is a shell that lets *you* plug in an AI provider (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). The quality, safety, and behavior of the AI depends entirely on the provider and model you choose. I do not control, endorse, or guarantee any AI's output.

**You are responsible for your own safety.** The AI operates in your visible terminal by default — commands run on your actual machine with your permissions. Always watch what it's doing. Do not leave it unattended. Do not give it access to sensitive systems without supervision.

**Things that can go wrong:**
- The AI may misinterpret your request and run a destructive command (`rm -rf`, `format`, `diskpart`, etc.)
- The AI may expose personal data it reads from your system
- The AI may have security vulnerabilities depending on the provider/model
- The app itself may have bugs — it's a spare-time project

**By using this software, you accept these risks.** If that doesn't sound right for you, that's completely fair — please don't use it.

## 🛠️ Build from Source (For Developers)

If you'd rather build it yourself:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (required for `node-pty` build on Windows)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valmapaura/terminalAi.git
cd terminalAi
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### First Launch (Source Build)

1. The app opens with a terminal (left) and chat (right)
2. Click **⚙️ Settings** (or press `Ctrl+,`)
3. Pick your AI provider and paste your API key
4. Start chatting — the AI can run commands, read terminal output, and help you script

---

## Usage

- **`Ctrl+,`** — Toggle settings
- **`Escape`** — Close command preview / settings
- **`Ctrl+L`** — Clear terminal
- Type in chat → AI responds with code blocks → click **⚡ Run** to execute
- Sandbox mode previews all commands before execution (enabled by default)

## Vision

OS Assistant is not just a terminal tool. It is a step toward an **Operating System Assistant** — an AI that understands and operates your machine the way a human would.

### The Long-Term Goal

We envision an AI that can:

- **Navigate any desktop application** — click buttons, fill forms, read UI elements, and perform multi-step workflows across any Windows application, not just the terminal.
- **Understand system state holistically** — monitor processes, services, event logs, network connections, and disk activity to give you a complete picture of what your computer is doing.
- **Automate complex OS tasks** — install software, configure system settings, manage users, troubleshoot drivers, and orchestrate multi-tool workflows without requiring custom scripting.
- **Learn from your patterns** — remember how you like your system configured, anticipate maintenance needs, and proactively suggest optimizations.
- **Cross-platform parity** — deliver the same deep integration on macOS and Linux, adapting to each platform's unique APIs and conventions.
- **Operate with transparency and safety** — always show what it intends to do, ask for confirmation on destructive actions, and let you audit every decision it made.

### Why This Matters

The terminal is the most powerful interface to a computer — but it has a steep learning curve. GUIs are accessible but limit what you can express. OS Assistant bridges the gap: it lets you express intent in natural language and translates that into precise, safe, multi-step operations across the full breadth of your operating system.

We start with the terminal because it is the most direct, most capable interface to the machine. From there, we expand to window management, application control, and eventually full OS orchestration — all while keeping you in control.

> **Today: A terminal AI that runs commands. Tomorrow: An AI that runs your computer — with your permission.**

## Security

- API keys encrypted at rest via Electron `safeStorage` (Windows Credential Manager)
- Commands validated before injection into the terminal
- Dangerous commands always require user confirmation
- Sandbox mode prevents any execution without preview
- CSP headers restrict renderer connectivity
